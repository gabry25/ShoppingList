Data structures
  All items inserted, hashed object
  list.itemName = {itemName,lastDate,duration,(expiration?,state?)}

  What I need/what I have (fridge) [just the name]
  the frist array is the shopping list itself (suggestions are recomputed each time)
    when removed from the fridge can go to shopping list (ask for)
  second array is what has been removed by previous (bought), can be edited, notifications for expirations
    deletion from here imply deletion on main (may ask for this)
    while adding here if the record is new it appears with default values, otherwise update date and duration
    when marked as done the element vanishes from here to appear in the fridge

Components
  lines in list trigger edit on touch and both done and delete buttons appear, touch out cancels the changes
  lines in suggestions can be deleted (erases record)
  $ is the fridge, the list is the same as suggestions, delete do not erases object
  each time I add something in the shopping list the duration is updated (average), when item is marked as done it enters the fridge and the lastDate is updated (may assign expiration too in this stage)

App (notes, done)
  Shopping note -> data
    MainList -> toBuy
      EditableItems (fetched from toBuy)
    Suggestions -> (all fetched)
    Fridge -> fridge
